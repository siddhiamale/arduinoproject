## ðŸš€ Voice-Controlled Car using Arduino  

This project enables a car to move based on voice commands using **Arduino UNO, HC-05 Bluetooth module, and L293D Motor Driver**. It processes commands like **Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Stop** through a mobile app. The **Bluetooth module** transmits data to Arduino, which controls the motors via the **L293D driver**. To set up, upload the Arduino code, connect the components, and pair HC-05 with a mobile app to send voice commands. Check the **circuit diagram (image3.png)** for connections. Feel free to **fork, contribute, and improve** this project! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
